# Password Strength Analysis 


## Task Objective

**Goal**: Understand what makes a password strong and test it against password strength tools.

**Method**: Test multiple passwords with varying complexity using online password strength checkers.

##  Testing Results

| Password | Score | Complexity | Length | Analysis |
|----------|-------|------------|--------|----------|
| `12345678` | 4% | Very Weak | 8 chars | Numbers only, consecutive pattern |
| `pass123` | 35% | Weak | 7 chars | Short, dictionary word |
| `password@123` | 65% | Strong | 12 chars | Common word, predictable |
| `G!v3Me$3cur!ty` | 100% | Very Strong | 14 chars | Good diversity, unpredictable |
| `RCB@salacupname2024` | 100% | Very Strong | 21 chars | Length compensates patterns |

##  Key Findings

### Weak Password Characteristics:
- Short length (< 8 characters)
- Single character type (numbers/letters only)
- Dictionary words
- Sequential patterns (123, abc)
- Predictable substitutions

### Strong Password Characteristics:
- 12+ characters in length
- Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- Unpredictable patterns
- No personal information
- Unique for each account

##  Security Recommendations

**Individual Users:**
- Use password managers
- Enable multi-factor authentication
- Create unique passwords per account
- Avoid personal information in passwords

**Organizations:**
- Implement strong password policies
- Enforce MFA across systems
- Provide security awareness training
- Monitor for credential breaches

##  Tools Used

- **[Password Meter](https://passwordmeter.com/)** - Primary testing tool
- **Testing Method**: Manual password entry and analysis
